      <h1>Dr.Muhammad Sajid</h1>
      <p>
        <em>
          Staff Geophysicst with 17 Years of O&G experience, <br />
          He has successfully developed several advanced seismic <br />
          technologies with practical applications in the upstream field</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        These technologies include algorithms for dip-guided seismic band- width expansion (non-stationary differential
        resolution or NSDR and structural-oriented dip-guided enhanced non-stationary differential resolution or eNSDR),
        e-coherency for structure- oriented denoising, spectral analysis, and decomposition, AI seismic attributes, as
        well as advanced Artificial Intelligence- based Seismic Features Recognition and Extraction technologies with
        vectorization capabilities for 2D, 2.5D, and 3D archi- tectures, seismic inversion, and reservoir
        characterization. Dr. Sajid has also played a pivotal role in staff development within geoscience seismic
        interpretation, conducting research and driving technological innovation. His work is well recognized, with
        publications in top journals and conferences. With over 17 years of experience in the oil industry, he currently
        serves as a principal geophysicist at PETRONAS, where he remains committed to exploring advanced technologies
        such as AI, ML, signal processing, and high-resolution reservoir characterization
