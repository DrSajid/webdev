        These technologies include algorithms for dip-guided seismic band- width expansion (non-stationary differential
        resolution or NSDR and structural-oriented dip-guided enhanced non-stationary differential resolution or eNSDR),
        e-coherency for structure- oriented denoising, spectral analysis, and decomposition, AI seismic attributes, as
        well as advanced Artificial Intelligence- based Seismic Features Recognition and Extraction technologies with
        vectorization capabilities for 2D, 2.5D, and 3D archi- tectures, seismic inversion, and reservoir
        characterization. Dr. Sajid has also played a pivotal role in staff development within geoscience seismic
        interpretation, conducting research and driving technological innovation. His work is well recognized, with
        publications in top journals and conferences. With over 17 years of experience in the oil industry, he currently
        serves as a principal geophysicist at PETRONAS, where he remains committed to exploring advanced technologies
        such as AI, ML, signal processing, and high-resolution reservoir characterization

              Learning Training: Dr. Sajid has trained the team extensively in advanced machine learning, empowering
              them to use AI and ML effectively in their work. 2. He’s taken the lead in creating and implementing
              innovative technologies for analyzing and using geological data in exploration and field development. 3.
              Successfully integrated an AI system called Seismic Features Recognition and Extraction (SFRE) that
              improves the effi- ciency of identifying and extracting im- portant geological information from seismic
              data, making the interpretation pro- cess easier. 4. AIML Seismic Attributes: Dr. Sajid specializes in
              creating AI-powered seis- mic attributes that pinpoint sand bodies and channels, even in challenging
              geology, greatly enhancing subsurface map- ping accuracy. 5. Geological-Driven Interpretation: Advocated
              for a geological-driven interpretation approach, aligning technology with geological principles to ensure
              that insights from seismic data are accurate and inform better decision-making. 6. AIML Seismic Super
              Resolution: His expertise extends to the development of AIML-based seismic super-resolution technologies.
              These advancements en- able the generation of high-resolution seismic images, providing a more detailed
              view of subsurface structures and improv- ing reservoir characterization.

        Dr.Sajid believes technical computing is an important skill to prototype out-of-the-box ideas, challenge general
        understanding, and provide efficient and higher precision solutions to the time-consuming and laborious
        repetitive tasks. That’s why technical computing is one of the important skills he kept developing along with
        technology mentoring, deployment, and management.
