      These technologies include algorithms for dip-guided seismic band- width expansion (non-stationary differential
      resolution or NSDR and structural-oriented dip-guided enhanced non-stationary differential resolution or eNSDR),
      e-coherency for structure- oriented denoising, spectral analysis, and decomposition, AI seismic attributes, as
      well as advanced Artificial Intelligence- based Seismic Features Recognition and Extraction technologies with
      vectorization capabilities for 2D, 2.5D, and 3D archi- tectures, seismic inversion, and reservoir
      characterization. Dr. Sajid has also played a pivotal role in staff development within geoscience seismic
      interpretation, conducting research and driving technological innovation. His work is well recognized, with
      publications in top journals and conferences. With over 17 years of experience in the oil industry, he currently
      serves as a principal geophysicist at PETRONAS, where he remains committed to exploring advanced technologies such

            to use AI and ML effectively in their work. 2. He’s taken the lead in creating and implementing innovative
            technologies for analyzing and using geological data in ex- ploration and field development. 3. Successfully
            integrated an AI system called Seismic Features Recognition and Extraction (SFRE) that improves the effi-
            ciency of identifying and extracting im- portant geological information from seis- mic data, making the
            interpretation pro- cess easier. 4. AIML Seismic Attributes: Dr. Sajid specializes in creating AI-powered
            seis- mic attributes that pinpoint sand bodies and channels, even in challenging geol- ogy, greatly
            enhancing subsurface map- ping accuracy. 5. Geological-Driven Interpretation: Advo- cated for a
            geological-driven interpretation approach, aligning technology with geo- logical principles to ensure that
            insights from seismic data are accurate and inform better decision-making. 6. AIML Seismic Super Resolution:
            His expertise extends to the development of AIML-based seismic super-resolution technologies. These
            advancements en- able the generation of high-resolution seismic images, providing a more detailed view of
            subsurface structures and improv- ing reservoir characterization.

    <h3>Programming Skills</h3>
    <p>
      Dr.Sajid believes technical computing is an important skill to prototype out-of-the-box ideas, challenge general
      understanding, and provide efficient and higher precision solutions to the time-consuming and laborious repetitive
      tasks. That’s why technical computing is one of the important skills he kept developing along with technology
      mentoring, deployment, and management.
